Connects WordPress 7.0's AI Client to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

== Description ==

WordPress 7.0 introduces a built-in AI Client with official connectors for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. This plugin extends that system to support **any service or server that speaks the OpenAI-compatible API format**.

**Supported services include:**

* **Ollama** - Run open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc.) locally on your own hardware.
* **LM Studio** - Desktop application for local LLM inference with a one-click server.
* **OpenRouter** - Unified API providing access to 100+ models from multiple providers.
* **Claude Max proxy** - Use Claude with token-based billing through an OpenAI-compatible proxy.
* **Any OpenAI-compatible server** - vLLM, text-generation-webui, LocalAI, and more.

**Why it matters:**

Other AI-powered plugins that use the WordPress AI Client (such as StifLi Flex MCP) can automatically discover and use any model you connect through this plugin. Configure your endpoint once and every AI feature on your site can use it.

**How it works:**

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to **Settings > OpenAI Compatible** and enter your endpoint URL (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama).
3. Optionally provide an API key for services that require authentication.
4. The plugin registers a provider with WordPress's AI Client and dynamically discovers all available models from your endpoint.

The plugin also handles practical concerns like extended HTTP timeouts for slow local inference and non-standard port support.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/openai-compatible-connector/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > OpenAI Compatible** and enter your endpoint URL.
4. Optionally enter an API key if your endpoint requires one.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is an OpenAI-compatible endpoint? =

Many AI inference servers and services implement the same API format that OpenAI uses (the `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` endpoints). This plugin works with any server that follows that format.

= Do I need an API key? =

It depends on your endpoint. Local servers like Ollama and LM Studio typically do not require a key. Cloud services like OpenRouter require one. Leave the API Key field blank for servers that do not need authentication.

= What models will be available? =

The plugin automatically queries your endpoint's `/models` resource and registers every model it finds. Whatever models your server offers will appear in the WordPress AI Client.

= Does this work with WordPress 6.x? =

No. The WordPress AI Client was introduced in WordPress 7.0. This plugin requires WordPress 7.0 or later.
